    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you refrain from grain, but can't go without pizza...you've got to try
      this version with a 1-ingredient crust made just from cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Â½ cups shredded part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>5 cherry tomatoes, thinly</li>
      <li>sliced 2 tablespoons torn fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>4 small fresh mozzarella</li>
      <li>balls (bocconcini), thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heat a 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Sprinkle
        shredded mozzarella cheese evenly into hot skillet; cook until cheese is
        melted, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange tomato slices, basil leaves, and fresh mozzarella slices on the
        melted cheese, leaving space for a "crust" to form; cook until top is
        bubbling and edges are browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove skillet from heat and loosen pizza with a spatula. Gently slice
        pizza onto a cutting board; cool for 1 minute before slicing.
      </li>
    </ul>
